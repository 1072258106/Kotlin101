This is a collection of runnable console applications that highlights the features of [Kotlin programming language](http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/Kotlin/Welcome).

The use of console application enable an easy way to demonstrate features of Kotlin programming language quickly.
All the code here compile under Kotlin Plugin M3.

I find it useful when I forgot certain Kotlin construct. Instead of looking up on the documentation, I just quickly checked the snippets in Kotlin101.
